These are the codes and data of the project told in https://medium.com/@virtualmartire/i-built-an-algorithm-that-finds-the-optimal-pokemon-team-01ea152824a9.

## algorithms

paldea.py is the script used to collect the datasets/paldea.csv data. Basically it uses BeautifulSoup to scan serebii.net and get all the relevant info.

## datasets

paldea.csv is the pokedex for the Paldea region (of Pokemon Scarlet & Violet), collected with the paldea.py script cited above. It comprises pokemon names, numbers, types and base stats.

In the attackdex folder you can find the single-pokemon learnable attacks data instead.

## to fix:
- in a few entry of the attackdex, some TMs are referred to the various forms of the relative pokemon...
- pokemon with multiple types combination can bring to ambiguous conclusions
